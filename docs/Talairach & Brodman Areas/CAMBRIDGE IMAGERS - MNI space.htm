<H1>The MNI brain and the Talairach atlas</H1></CENTER>
<P>This page discusses the MNI brain, and the difference between the MNI brain 
and the brain in the Talairach atlas. These issues are also discussed in less 
detail in my <A 
href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/~matthew.brett/articles/location.html">localization 
paper</A>. 
<P>SPM 96 and SPM 99 use standard brains from the Montreal Neurological 
Institute. The MNI defined a new standard brain by using a large series of MRI 
scans on normal controls. Recall that the Talairach brain is the brain dissected 
and photographed for the famous Talairach and Tournoux atlas. The atlas has 
Brodmann's areas labelled, albeit in a rather approximate way. In fact what the 
authors did was to look at pictures of the Brodmann map and estimate where the 
same place was on their brain. To quote from the atlas, p 10: "The brain 
presented here was not subjected to histological studies and the transfer of the 
cartography of Brodmann usually pictured in two dimensional projections 
sometimes possesses uncertainties". 
<P>The MNI wanted to define a brain that is more representative of the 
population. They created a new template that was approximately matched to the 
Talairach brain in a two-stage procedure. First, they took 241 normal MRI scans, 
and manually defined various landmarks, in order to identify a line very similar 
to the AC-PC line, and the edges of the brain. Each brain was scaled to match 
the landmarks to equivalent positions on the Talairach atlas. They then took 305 
normal MRI scans (all right handed, 239 M, 66 F, age 23.4 +/- 4.1), and used an 
automated 9 parameter linear algorithm to match the brains to the average of the 
241 brains that had been matched to the Talairach atlas. From this they 
generated an average of 305 brain scans thus transformed - the MNI305. See <A 
href="http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/users/louis/papers/phd_thesis">Louis Collins' 
thesis</A> for a detailed description; the <A 
href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/mnispace.html#evans_proc">conference 
paper by Evans et al</A> also describes the process. 
<P>The MNI305 was the first MNI template. The current standard MNI template is 
the ICBM152, which is the average of 152 normal MRI scans that have been matched 
to the MNI305 using a 9 parameter affine transform. The <A 
href="http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ICBM">International Consortium for Brain 
Mapping</A> adopted this as their standard template; it is the standard template 
in SPM99. 
<P>In addition, one of the MNI lab members, Colin Holmes, was scanned 27 times, 
and the scans were coregistered and averaged to create a very high detail MRI 
dataset of one brain. This average was also matched to the MNI305, to create the 
image known as "colin27". colin27 is used in the <A 
href="http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb/">MNI brainweb simulator</A>. SPM96 
used colin27 as its standard template. You can <A 
href="ftp://ftp.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/pub/imaging/Colin">download a copy of this 
image at 1mm resolution</A> from our site; SPM96 contains a 2mm resolution copy 
of the same image, called T1.img in the SPM canonical directory. Note that the 
images in the SPM "templates" directories have all been presmoothed to 8mm for 
use with the normalization routines. 
<P>The problem introduced by the MNI standard brains is that the MNI linear 
transform has not matched the brains completely to the Talairach brain. As a 
result the MNI brains are slightly larger (in particular higher, deeper and 
longer) than the Talairach brain. The differences are larger as you get further 
from the middle of the brain, towards the outside, and are at maximum in the 
order of 10mm. In particular, MNI brain is ~5mm taller (from the AC to the top 
of the brain) and ~5mm longer. The temporal lobes go about 10mm deeper in MNI 
(see e.g. MNI coordinate X = 32 Y = -4 Z = -50; the lowest slice in the 
Talairach atlas is at -40). Another example of the mismatch is that at -8 -76 -8 
you are firmly in the occipital cortex in the MNI brain, whereas the same 
coordinates in the Talairach atlas put you in CSF. 
<P>The differences are not obvious on axial sections, but are clear on coronal 
slices. The picture below shows the MNI 152 averate brain section from the SPM 
distribution, next to the equivalent section of the Talairach atlas. The section 
is at y = -4; there is a vertical line at 30mm in x, and horizontal lines at z = 
0, 73 and -41, the AC top and bottom of the Talairach brain. As the picture 
shows, the top of the brain is higher in MNI, and the temporal lobes are 
considerably lower and larger than for the Talairach brain: 
<P><IMG src="CAMBRIDGE IMAGERS - MNI space_files/mnitalcor.jpg"> 
<P>
<P>As we discussed above, SPM uses the brains from the MNI for its templates. 
SPM99b uses the MNI average of 152 scans, and SPM96 uses the scan data from the 
individual brain that has been scanned many times. 
<P>This means that the Talairach atlas is not exactly accurate for interpreting 
coordinates from SPM analyses, if (as is almost always the case) the scans have 
been spatially normalized (coregistered) to the SPM 99 or SPM 96 template. This 
can be problem, as, to my knowledge, there is currently no published MNI atlas, 
defining Brodmann's areas on the MNI brain. In contrast there is extensive 
information on Brodmann's areas for the Talairach atlas. 
<P>However, the SPM authors have referred to the coordinates from SPM96,99 
analyses (matched to the MNI brain) as being 'in Talairach space' (see <A 
href="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/spm/1998-06/0076.html">message on SPM 
mailing list</A>). By this they mean that the coordinates are reported in terms 
of the system that Talairach developed, with coordinate 0,0,0 being at the <A 
href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/antcomm.html">anterior commissure</A> 
(AC), and with the anterior / posterior commissural line (AC/PC line) defining 
the the plane where z = 0. (In fact the AC is not exactly at 0,0,0 in the MNI 
brain, but about 4mm below - see the 152 T1 average brain in the canonical 
directory). However, they do <B>not</B> mean by this that the coordinates match 
the brain in the Talairach atlas, because this is not precisely the case. 
<P>
<P>
<H2>Converting MNI coordinates to Talairach coordinates</H2>
<P>So, if you have coordinates for an image already normalized to SPM-MNI space, 
what are the equivalent cooordinates in Talairach? 
<P>There is no definitive answer to this. The problem is that the Talairach 
brain is a significantly different shape to the MNI brain. In particular the 
temporal lobes are relatively larger in the MNI brain. Recall that the MNI has 
already been coregistered to the Talairach brain with linear transforms; the 
reason that this has not resulted in a very good match is the difference in 
brain shape. 
<P>So, here are two approaches to translating MNI coordinates to Talairach. 
<P>
<H3>Approach 1: redo the affine transform</H3>This very reasonable approach has 
been <A href="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/spm/1998-06/0079.html">posted to 
the SPM mailing list</A> by <A href="mailto:meyera@intra.nimh.nih.gov">Andreas 
Meyer-Lindenberg</A>, of NIMH. The following is copied from the text of that 
message, with a small correction (kindly pointed out to me by Darren Gitelman on 
the SPM mailing list): 
<P>"I have taken the SPM 95 PET template (which is reasonably "Talairach 
88-compatible", as far as I know) and used the spatial normalization algorithm 
of SPM 96 with an affine transform to map it onto the SPM 96 template (which is 
"MNI compatible"). If you do this and disregard parameter values for the affine 
transform that are very small, you come up with the following formulae for 
translating between the two coordinate systems: 
<P>To get from McGill [MNI] -SPM96-coordinates to Talairach 88-SPM 95 
coordinates: 
<P>X' = 0.88X-0.8 
<P>Y' = 0.97Y-3.32 
<P>Z' = 0.05Y+0.88Z-0.44" 
<P>So, to get a best guess at where your MNI point would be on the Talairach 
atlas, using the method described above, you can use matlab. Place the following 
matlab function somewhere in your matlab path (save the following as 
aff_mni2tal.m): 
<P><PRE>function outpoint = aff_mni2tal(inpoint)
Tfrm = [0.88 0 0 -0.8;0 0.97 0 -3.32; 0 0.05 0.88 -0.44;0 0 0 1];
tmp = Tfrm * [inpoint 1]';
outpoint = tmp(1:3)';
</PRE>
<P>Let us say that you have a point, from the MNI brain, that you want some 
Talairach equivalent coordinate for. The point might be: X = 10mm, Y = 12mm, Z = 
14mm. 
<P>With this function on your path, you could type the following at the matlab 
prompt: 
<P><PRE>aff_mni2tal([10 12 14])
</PRE>
<P>Which would give the following output (see above): 
<P><PRE>ans =

    8.0000    8.3200   12.4800

</PRE>
<P>This gives you the affine method's estimate of the equivalent X, Y and Z 
coordinates in the Talairach brain. 
<P>There are two problems with this approach: 
<UL>
  <LI>The first problem is very simple; we have no MRI scan of the brain in the 
  Talairach atlas. The SPM95 brain was smaller than the MNI brain, but it is 
  still not a perfect match for the Talairach atlas; see <A 
  href="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/spm/1997-12/0061.html">another message 
  on the SPM mailing list</A>. 
  <LI>The second problem is the same as the problem with the orginal transform 
  done by the MNI: the brains are a different shape. For example, because the 
  temporal lobes are fatter in the MNI brain, the affine transform needs to 
  squeeze these down, by multplying the Z coordinates by a factor of about 0.88. 
  However, this results in the top of the brain being pulled rather too far 
  down, so that it is about 6mm below the highest point on the Talairach atlas. 
  </LI></UL>
<P>
<H3>Approach 2: a non-linear transform of MNI to Talairach</H3>An alternative is 
to use some sort of transformation that may differ for different brain areas. 
One method might be to do an automated non-linear match of the MNI to the 
Talairach brain. For example, you could apply an SPM or AIR warping algorithm. 
However, there are two problems here. First, as we stated above, we do not have 
an MRI image of the brain in the Talairach atlas, which was a post-mortem 
specimen. Second, the automated non-linear transforms produce quite complex 
equations relating the two sets of coordinates. 
<P>An alternative is to apply something like the transform that Talairach and 
Tournoux designed; here different linear transforms are applied to different 
brain regions. This is the approach I describe below. 
<P>To get a good match for both the temporal lobes and the top of the brain, I 
used different zooms, in the Z (down/up) direction, for the brain above the 
level of the AC/PC line, and the brain below. The algorithm was:
<UL>
  <LI>I assumed that the AC was in the correct position in the MNI brain, and 
  therefore that no translations were necessary; 
  <LI>Assumed that the MNI brain was in the correct orientation in terms of 
  rotation around the Y axis (roll) and the Z axis (yaw); 
  <LI>Using the SPM99b display tool, I compared the MNI brain to the images in 
  the Talairach atlas; 
  <LI>Compared to the atlas, the MNI brain seemed tipped backwards, so that the 
  cerebellar / cerebral cortex line in the sagittal view, at the AC, was too 
  low. Similarly, the bottom of the anterior part of the corpus collosum seemed 
  too high. I therefore applied a small (0.05 radian) pitch correction to the 
  MNI brain; 
  <LI>Matching the top of the MNI brain to the top of the brain in the atlas, 
  required a zoom of 0.92 in Z. Similarly a Y zoom of 0.97 was required as a 
  best compromise in matching the front and back of the MNI brain to the atlas. 
  The left / right match required a 0.99 zoom in X; 
  <LI>The transform above provided a good match for the brain superior to the 
  AC/PC line, but a poor match below, with the temporal lobes extending further 
  downwards in the MNI brain than in the atlas. I therefore derived a transform 
  for the brain below the AC/PC line, that was the same as the transform above, 
  except with a Z zoom of 0.84; </LI></UL>
<P>This algorithm gave me the following transformations: 
<P>Above the AC (Z &gt;= 0): 
<P>X'= 0.9900X 
<P>Y'= 0.9688Y +0.0460Z 
<P>Z'= -0.0485Y +0.9189Z 
<P>
<P>Below the AC (Z &lt; 0): 
<P>X'= 0.9900X 
<P>Y'= 0.9688Y +0.0420Z 
<P>Z'= -0.0485Y +0.8390Z 
<P>
<P>The matlab function <A 
href="ftp://ftp.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/pub/imaging/MNI2tal/mni2tal.m" 
target=display_area>mni2tal.m</A> implements these transforms. It returns 
estimated Talairach coordinates, from the transformations above, for given 
points in the MNI brain. To use it, save as mni2tal.m somewhere on your matlab 
path. 
<P>So, taking our example point in the MNI brain, X = 10mm, Y = 12mm, Z = 14mm: 
<P>With the mni2tal.m function above on your path, you could type the following 
at the matlab prompt: 
<P><PRE>mni2tal([10 12 14])
</PRE>
<P>Which would give the following output (see above): 
<P><PRE>ans =

    9.9000   12.2692   12.2821

</PRE>
<P>which is, again, an estimate of the equivalent X, Y and Z coordinates in the 
Talairach brain. 
<P>The inverse function, <A 
href="ftp://ftp.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/pub/imaging/MNI2tal/tal2mni.m" 
target=display_area>tal2mni.m</A>, gives MNI coordinates for given Talairach 
coordinates, using the same algorithm. 
<P>We could of course do a more complex transform to attempt to make a closer 
match between the two brains. The approach above is only intended to be 
preliminary. It does have the advantage that it is very simple, and therefore 
the distortions involved are easy to visualise, and unlikely to have dramatic 
unexpected effects. 
<P>Incidentally, if you use the above transform, and you want to cite it, I 
suggest that you cite this web address. The transform is also mentioned briefly 
in the following papers: Duncan, J., Seitz, R.J., Kolodny, J., Bor, D., Herzog, 
H., Ahmed, A., Newell, F.N., Emslie, H. "A neural basis for General 
Intelligence", Science (21 July 2000), 289 (5478), 457-460; Calder, A.J., 
Lawrence, A.D. and Young,A.W. "Neuropsychology of Fear and Loathing" Nature 
Reviews Neuroscience (2001), Vol.2 No.5 352-363 
<P>
<P>
<H2>Other methods for locating your activation</H2>
<P>Other methods that you can use to work out where your activation is are; 
<UL>
  <LI>Use the SPM 99 and 96 overlay displays to show you the activations on the 
  MNI brain. If you know your anatomy well, or can see the equivalent structures 
  in the Talairach atlas, then you may know where your activation is. 
  Unfortunately, outside the primary sesorimotor cortices, the relation of 
  functional areas to sulcal anatomy can be very variable; 
  <LI>Use the Talairach atlas, and try by eye to take into account the 
  difference in brain size (given that the differences are relatively small). 
  Obviously this can be inaccurate, and it is very difficult to standardise 
  across labs. </LI></UL>
