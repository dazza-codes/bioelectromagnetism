The header table is constructed to have only two moving parts, the width of the graphic, and the width of the blue line to the right of the graphic.  
In this example, the header.gif width="300" and the pixelclear width="171" (in three places). 

The pixelclear width="120" should never be touched unless the rightnav width of 120 is altered for some reason (which should NEVER happen except for international pages)
The height tags should in NO instance EVER be moved.

      <P><SPAN class=head3>Details about DICOM Metadata</SPAN><BR>As shown in 
      the previous example, a typical DICOM file contains numerous attributes. 
      The reason for this is that DICOM messages encapsulate <EM>all</EM> of the 
      information about a medical imaging procedure, including details about the 
      patient, study, imaging modality, and image series in addition to the 
      image frame stored in the file. Together, all of these attributes comprise 
      an<EM> Information Object.</EM></P>
      <P>The DICOM specification contains numerous <EM>Information Object 
      Definitions </EM>(IODs), such as MR Image, Ultrasound Multiframe Image, 
      and Radiotherapy Plan. The DICOM files in the examples above contain MR 
      Image Information Objects. <CODE class=fnctn>dicomread</CODE> understands 
      most IODs that are listed in the DICOM specification.</P>
      <P>IODs are defined in terms of smaller functional units, or 
      <EM>modules</EM>, which correspond to specific real-world objects, such as 
      patients, imaging equipment, etc. The hundred-or-so modules in DICOM 
      describe everything that could be combined to make a DICOM information 
      object. For example, the following table lists the modules that constitute 
      an MR Image IOD:</P>

      <P>Some modules, such as Patient, General Study, General Equipment, and 
      Image Pixel, are found in many IODs. Other modules appear only in specific 
      IODs. The MR Image module, for example, is only part of the MR Image 
      IOD.</P>
      <P>The IOD contains modules that describe the patient, study, series, and 
      images for a particular medical imaging procedure. Also, notice that some 
      modules have a "(C)" or "(U)" near their name, which means that for this 
      IOD they are "conditionally required" or "user optional" modules; the 
      conditional and user optional modules may or may not appear in every MR 
      Image IOD. For example, the Contrast/Bolus module will only appear if 
      medication is given at the time of imaging, and the VOI LUT module does 
      not have to be implemented by the device that writes the DICOM file.</P>
      <P>All of the modules and attributes are defined in PS 3.3 of the DICOM 
      specification, which are available online from the <A 
      href="http://medical.nema.org/" target=_blank>National Electrical 
      Manufacturer’s Association</A>. Additionally, all of the defined 
      attributes are listed in a data dictionary. Vendors sometimes define 
      private attributes that are specific to their hardware. While you do not 
      need to do anything special to read private attributes with <CODE 
      class=fnctn>dicomread</CODE> or <CODE class=fnctn>dicominfo</CODE>, if you 
      want to provide additional information about attributes that are not part 
      of the DICOM specification, you can provide your own data dictionary.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=head3>Writing DICOM Files</SPAN><BR>We will now create a 
      new DICOM file. Writing a new file requires an image and metadata. We 
      created a new image with the scaled data in one of the examples above, and 
      <CODE class=fnctn>dicomwrite</CODE> and <CODE class=fnctn>dicominfo</CODE> 
      will help us create the metadata we need. </P>
      <P>To write a DICOM file, simply use <CODE class=fnctn>dicomwrite</CODE> 
      in the Image Processing Toolbox. Currently, this function supports 
      creating Secondary Capture (SC) Image IODs, which contain all of the pixel 
      data and metadata necessary for correctly interpreting the image. 
      Essentially, an SC image is similar to what you would generate with a 
      framegrabber, or if you had generated the image yourself from scratch or 
      from another image (as in the example above). Metadata about the patient, 
      image, and study will be present, but information about the original 
      hardware that produced the image will not.</P>
      <P>To write the tenth frame of the scaled image using default metadata to 
      a new file, use <CODE class=fnctn>dicomwrite</CODE> with its basic 
      syntax:</P>
      <P><CODE>frame = Y(:,:,:,10);<BR>filename = 
      'brain_scaled_10.dcm';<BR>dicomwrite(frame, filename)</CODE></P>
      <P>In this example, <CODE class=fnctn>dicomwrite</CODE> infers the 
      metadata that is required, filling in blank values where appropriate. To 
      override default values, provide <CODE class=fnctn>dicomwrite</CODE> with 
      a structure containing attributes:</P>
      <P><CODE>info = dicominfo('brain_001.dcm');<BR>dicomwrite(frame, filename, 
      info)</CODE></P>
      <P><CODE class=fnctn>dicomwrite</CODE> picks the values that apply to the 
      Secondary Capture IOD and ignores the rest. When <CODE 
      class=fnctn>dicomwrite</CODE> makes a new file, it is actually performing 
      two operations. First, it creates a Secondary Capture information object. 
      Then it encodes the information object’s attributes, turning them into a 
      stream of bytes that are written to the output file. This last step 
      demonstrates the DICOM concept of <EM>services</EM>.</P>
      <P>A service provides a set of concrete actions to perform on objects. 
      Common services include Storage, Print Management, Verification, and 
      Query/Retrieve. When dealing with network messages, services are 
      implemented by adding extra attributes to the message and then sending a 
      series of instructions to the receiving machine or application, which 
      deciphers the extra attributes to figure out what to do with the message. 
      When working with DICOM files, the attributes are added to the file, and 
      writing or reading the file replaces the transfer of instructions.</P>
      <P>Writing a file containing DICOM data is very much like performing the 
      Storage service. Essentially, the IOD's attributes plus those for the 
      Storage service are combined and "frozen" when written to disk. Reading 
      the file "thaws" the IOD and service attributes, and the entire context of 
      what to do with the information is preserved.</P>
      <P>Encoding rules found in the DICOM standard provide the algorithm for 
      transforming attributes into a series of bytes to be transmitted or 
      stored. Different byte-ordering schemes can be used during encoding, and 
      image pixels can be compressed using numerous techniques, such as JPEG or 
      run-length encoding. In the calls to <CODE class=fnctn>dicomwrite</CODE> 
      above, the files are encoded using so-called “implicit VR, little endian” 
      style, and the pixels are not compressed.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=head3>Working Together</SPAN><BR>A host of <EM>Transfer 
      Syntaxes</EM> unambiguously define how to decode a DICOM message. One of 
      these transfer syntaxes appears at the beginning of a DICOM network 
      transmission or at the start of a DICOM file. If both the sender/writer 
      and receiver/reader support the same transfer syntax, communication 
      proceeds. Otherwise, communication fails. The DICOM features in MATLAB and 
      the Image Processing Toolbox support the most commonly used transfer 
      syntaxes.</P>
      <P>With all of these possibilities—IODs, optional modules, services, and 
      transfer syntaxes—it can be difficult to know exactly how well two 
      modalities will interact. Implementing a service requires knowing which 
      attributes to send or receive. Furthermore, making the service useful 
      frequently requires knowing what kind of data to put into attributes and 
      verifying that the information is correct. Consequently, few manufacturers 
      support the full set of "Service-Object Pairs" that are possible in DICOM. 
      In addition, different applications support different transfer 
      syntaxes.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, every application that implements part of DICOM should 
      know what it supports. Manufacturers publish the information about the 
      services, IODs, and transfer syntaxes that they support in DICOM 
      <EM>conformance statements</EM>. By comparing statements from two 
      different vendors, you can identify whether the two applications can share 
      information.</P>
      <P><SPAN class=head3>Limitless Possibilities with DICOM</SPAN><BR>DICOM 
      makes it easy to acquire and put medical images into a file. It is 
      becoming more prevalent in the medical field.</P>
      <P>Many medical device manufacturers and software manufacturers are adding 
      DICOM to just about any product that can work with medical images and 
      data. </P>
      <P>Using MATLAB with the Image Processing Toolbox provides easy access to 
      medical images, modality metadata, and patient information within DICOM 
      files. They also provide numerical and image processing algorithms, 
      GUI-building tools, and visualization techniques. With MATLAB, the Image 
      Processing Toolbox, and DICOM it is possible to quickly view medical 
      images, design and test new modalities, and create GUI-driven medical 
      image analysis systems.</P>
